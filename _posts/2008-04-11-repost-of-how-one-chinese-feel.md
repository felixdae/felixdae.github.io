How one chinese feel?

This comment is from a sfgate newspaper blog of how one chinese feel?

What do you want from Us? - A Poem Dedicated to the last 150 years of this pla
net. By a Slient, Silent Chinese.

When We were called Sick man of Asia, We were called The Peril. When We are bi
lled to be the next Superpower, We are called The threat. When We were closed 
our doors, You smuggled Drugs to Open Markets. When We Embrace Freed Trade, Yo
u blame us for Taking away your jobs. When We were falling apart, You marched 
in your troops and wanted your fair share. When We were putting the broken pei
ces together again, Free Tibet you screamed, it was an invasion! ( When Woodro
w Wilson Couldnt give back Birth Place of Confucius back to Us, But He did bou
ght a ticket for the Famine Relief Ball for us.) So, We Tried Communism, You h
ated us for being Communists. When We embrace Capitalism, You hate us for bein
g Capitalist. When We have a Billion People, you said we were destroying the p
lanet. When We are tried limited our numbers, you said It was human rights abu
se.

When We were Poor, You think we are dogs. When We Loan you cash, You blame us 
for your debts. When We build our industries, You called us Polluters. When we
sell you goods, You blame us for global warming. When We buy oil, You called 
that exploitation and Genocide. When You fight for oil, You called that Libera
tion. When We were lost in Chaos and rampage, You wanted Rules of Law for us. 
When We uphold law and order against Violence, You called that Violating Human
Rights. When We were silent, You said you want us to have Free Speech. When W
e were silent no more, You say we were Brainwashed-Xenophoics.

Why do you hate us so much? We asked. No, You Answered, We dont hate You. We d
ont Hate You either, But Do you understand us? Of course We do, You said, We h
ave AFP, CNN and BBCs What do you really want from us? Think Hard first
